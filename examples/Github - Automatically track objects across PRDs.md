GitHub Repo Approach:

- Create a dedicated repository to store your PRDs. Each PRD can be a separate file within the repository.
- Use a consistent naming convention for PRD files to easily identify their purpose.
- Utilize a structured folder hierarchy to organize your PRDs based on different modules or functional areas.
- Within each PRD file, clearly identify and mark the objects and actions using comments or special annotations.
- Add cross-references in the PRDs to indicate where the objects and actions are being used.
- Leverage GitHub's issue tracking feature to create issues for each object and action, linking them to the relevant PRDs.
- Use labels or tags to categorize and track the different objects and actions across the repository.
- Regularly review and update the PRDs and associated issues to reflect any changes or updates.
