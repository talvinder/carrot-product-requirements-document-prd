In this enhanced PRD, I have added additional scenarios to cover different user flows and edge cases. Each scenario includes specific acceptance criteria, which define the expected behavior or outcome. Additionally, user interface mockups or wireframes can be included alongside each scenario to provide visual representations of the expected user interface and interactions.

Remember, in a real-world scenario, you would provide more detailed acceptance criteria, mockups, and edge cases based on the specific requirements of your e-commerce platform.
