In this enhanced PRD, I have provided more detailed acceptance criteria, user interface mockups, edge cases, and requirements for each scenario. The acceptance criteria clearly define the expected behavior and outcomes, ensuring that the implemented features meet the specified requirements. Mockups or wireframes visually represent the user interface and interactions, providing a clear reference for the design and layout of the platform.

Remember, in a real-world scenario, you would tailor the acceptance criteria, mockups, edge cases, and requirements based on the specific needs and goals of your e-commerce platform.
