The advantage of writing the above PRD using Carrot syntax is the ability to extract and track objects and actions across multiple PRDs. Carrot provides a structured and standardized format for writing scenarios and steps, allowing for better organization and traceability of requirements.

Specifically, Carrot allows you to define objects as data entities and actions as operations on those objects. By using Carrot's syntax and keywords, you can easily identify and track these objects and actions throughout your PRDs.

For example, let's consider the scenario "Add Product to Cart" from the previous PRD. In Carrot syntax, it can be written as:

```gherkin
Scenario: Add Product to Cart
  Given I am on the product details page
  When I click on "Add to Cart"
  Then the product should be added to my cart
```

In this scenario, the object is the "product," and the action is "add to cart." By using Carrot's keywords, you can extract and track these objects and actions across multiple PRDs. This becomes particularly useful when you have interconnected features or scenarios that rely on the same objects and actions.

For instance, if you have another scenario like "Remove Product from Cart" in a different PRD, you can easily refer back to the object and action defined in the previous PRD. It would look something like this:

```gherkin
Scenario: Remove Product from Cart
  Given I am on the cart page
  When I click on "Remove" for the product added to my cart
  Then the product should be removed from my cart
```

Here, the object "product" and the action "remove from cart" are referenced from the previous PRD, creating a clear connection and ensuring consistency across different PRDs.

By using Carrot syntax and the ability to extract and track objects and actions, you can easily maintain and manage the relationships between different PRDs. It helps in avoiding duplication, ensuring consistency, and simplifying the process of updating or modifying the PRDs when necessary.
