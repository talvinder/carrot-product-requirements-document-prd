# Carrot

Carrot is a powerful domain-specific language and framework for writing expressive scenarios and automating tests using a behavior-driven development (BDD) approach. It extends the Gherkin syntax and provides additional keywords and features for more flexibility and readability.

## Features

- **Expressive Scenarios:** Write scenarios using the Carrot syntax to describe desired behaviors and outcomes in a human-readable format.
- **Parameterization with Scenario Outlines:** Use scenario outlines to create data-driven tests and iterate over multiple inputs or scenarios.
- **Data Tables:** Utilize data tables to handle structured data within scenarios and perform multiple validations or assertions.
- **Backgrounds:** Define backgrounds to set up common preconditions and ensure scenarios start from a consistent state.
- **Tags and Annotations:** Organize and manage scenarios with tags and annotations to enable selective test execution and categorization.
- **Integration with Testing Frameworks:** Seamlessly integrate Carrot with popular testing frameworks for easy test execution and reporting.
- **Reporting and Documentation:** Generate comprehensive reports and documentation from Carrot scripts to track test coverage and share project progress.
