# Carrot: Simplifying and Enhancing PRD Creation

Welcome to the Carrot repository! Carrot is a powerful and intuitive tool designed to revolutionize the way we create Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) for software development projects. In this readme, we will explore the key reasons why Carrot was created and how it can significantly improve your PRD creation process.

## Why Carrot?

### 1. Faster Reading and Understanding

Carrot introduces a concise and expressive syntax that allows for faster reading and understanding of PRDs. With its simplified language constructs and intuitive keywords, Carrot PRDs are easier to parse and comprehend. This means that stakeholders, developers, and other team members can quickly grasp the requirements and intentions of a feature or functionality, enabling more efficient collaboration.

**Example:**

```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  As a user
  I want to log in to the system
  So that I can access my personalized content

  Scenario: Successful Login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid credentials
    And click the "Login" button
    Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
    And see a welcome message
```

### 2. Faster Creation and Iteration

Carrot provides a streamlined syntax and structure, allowing for faster creation and iteration of PRDs. With its keyword-driven approach, you can easily capture requirements, define acceptance criteria, and outline user interactions. The use of reusable steps and scenario outlines further accelerates the PRD creation process, reducing the time spent on writing and maintaining documentation.

**Example:**

```gherkin
Feature: Product Search
  As a customer
  I want to search for products
  So that I can find what I'm looking for quickly

  Scenario Outline: Searching by Keyword
    Given I am on the home page
    When I enter "<keyword>" in the search field
    And click the search button
    Then I should see a list of products related to "<keyword>"

    Examples:
      | keyword  |
      | carrots  |
      | tomatoes |
      | apples   |
```

### 3. Improved Structure and Organization

Carrot introduces a structured approach to PRD writing, making it easier to organize and navigate through complex requirements. With features, scenarios, steps, and tags, you can create a hierarchical structure that reflects the product's functionality. This allows for better traceability and maintainability of requirements, ensuring that no critical details are overlooked.

**Example:**

```gherkin
Feature: Order Management
  As a store owner
  I want to manage customer orders
  So that I can fulfill them efficiently

  Scenario: Viewing Order Details
    Given I am on the order management page
    When I click on an order with ID "<order_id>"
    Then I should see the details of the order

    @priority-high
    Scenario: Cancelling an Order
      Given I am on the order management page
      When I select an order with ID "<order_id>"
      And click the "Cancel" button
      Then the order status should be set to "Cancelled"
```

### 4. Object Tracking and Action Tracing

One of the key advantages of Carrot is its ability to track objects and trace actions across multiple PRDs. By defining clear object names and using consistent action keywords, you can establish a unified language that ensures a seamless flow of information between PRDs. This enables better collaboration, reduces duplication of effort, and enhances the overall clarity and coherence of the PRD ecosystem.

**Example:**

| Object          | Action             | Status   | PRD Title                         |
|-----------------|--------------------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| User            | Create Account     | Planned  | User Management                   |
| User            | Log In             | Implemented | User Authentication            |
| User            | Update Profile     | Planned  | User Profile Management           |
| Product         | Add to Cart        | Implemented | Shopping Cart                  |
| Product         | Remove from Cart   | Planned  | Shopping Cart                      |
| Product         | View Details       | Implemented | Product Details                  |
| Order           | Place Order        | Implemented | Order Placement                 |
| Order           | Cancel Order       | Planned  | Order Management                  |
| Payment         | Make Payment       | Planned  | Payment Processing                |
| Payment         | Refund Payment     | Implemented | Payment Refunds                 |

Please note that this is just a simplified example to demonstrate how the table could be structured. In a real-world scenario, the table would include more objects, actions, and PRDs, along with additional columns such as priority, release version, and more detailed status information.
