# Benefits of Carrot and Challenges with Traditional PRDs

In this document, we will explore the benefits of Carrot over traditional PRDs and highlight the challenges faced with the traditional approach. Each benefit and challenge will be accompanied by an example to provide a clearer understanding.

## Benefit: Clarity and Consistency

Traditional PRDs often lack clarity and consistency, leading to misunderstandings and misinterpretations among stakeholders. Carrot addresses this challenge by introducing a structured syntax that ensures clear and concise expression of features, actions, and outcomes.

**Example: User Authentication**

*Traditional PRD:*

Feature: User Authentication

Description:
The system should authenticate users before granting access to the application.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The user should provide a valid username and password.
- The system should verify the user's credentials against the database.
- Upon successful authentication, the user should be redirected to the home page.

*Explanation:* The traditional PRD example provides a general description and acceptance criteria for user authentication. However, it lacks clarity on the specific steps involved in the process. Carrot, on the other hand, provides a more structured and clear representation of the scenario, ensuring a better understanding of the authentication flow.

*Carrot:*

Feature: User Authentication

Scenario: User Login

Given the user is on the login page
When the user enters a valid username and password
Then the user should be redirected to the home page

## Benefit: Collaboration and Alignment

Traditional PRDs often pose challenges in collaboration and alignment between product managers, designers, and developers. Carrot addresses this challenge by using a simplified language that bridges the gap between stakeholders, fostering effective communication, shared understanding, and collaboration.

**Example: Payment Gateway Integration**

*Traditional PRD:*

Feature: Payment Gateway Integration

Description:
Integrate a payment gateway to enable users to make online payments. The integration should support multiple payment methods and ensure secure transactions.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The system should display a list of available payment methods on the checkout page.
- The user should be able to select a preferred payment method.
- Upon successful payment, the system should display a confirmation message.

*Explanation:* The traditional PRD example provides a high-level description and acceptance criteria for payment gateway integration. However, it lacks the specific steps and interactions involved in the process. Carrot, with its simplified syntax, enables a more collaborative and aligned approach by clearly defining the scenario and actions required for payment gateway integration.

*Carrot:*

Feature: Payment Gateway Integration

Scenario: User Makes a Payment

Given the user is on the checkout page
When the user selects a payment method
And completes the payment process
Then the system should display a confirmation message

## Benefit: Testability and Quality Assurance

Traditional PRDs often lack testability, resulting in inconsistencies between requirements and implemented features. Carrot addresses this challenge by following behavior-driven development (BDD) principles, allowing for the creation of executable specifications that serve as living documentation and facilitate automated testing.

**Example: Search Functionality**

*Traditional PRD:*

Feature: Search Functionality

Description:
Implement a search feature that allows users to search for products based on keywords. The search should provide accurate and relevant results.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The system should display a search bar on the home page.
- The user should be able to enter search keywords and initiate a search.
- The system should retrieve relevant products based on the search keywords.

*Explanation:* The traditional PRD example provides a general description and acceptance criteria for search functionality. However, it lacks the specific steps and expected outcomes for testing. Carrot, with its behavior-driven development approach, enables the creation of executable specifications that serve as living documentation and can be utilized for automated testing.

*Carrot:*

Feature: Search Functionality

Scenario: User Searches for Products

Given the user is on the home page
When the user enters search keywords and initiates a search
Then the system should retrieve relevant products

## Benefit: Flexibility and Iteration

Traditional PRDs often lack flexibility, making it challenging to accommodate changes and iterations during the product development process. Carrot addresses this challenge by providing a more flexible syntax that allows for easy modifications and iterative refinement of requirements.

**Example: User Profile Updates**

*Traditional PRD:*

Feature: User Profile Updates

Description:
Allow users to update their profile information, including name, email, and profile picture.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The system should display a profile settings page.
- The user should be able to edit their name, email, and profile picture.
- The updated information should be saved in the database.

*Explanation:* The traditional PRD example provides a basic description and acceptance criteria for user profile updates. However, it lacks the flexibility to handle additional profile fields or evolving requirements. Carrot's flexible syntax allows for easy modifications and iterative refinement of requirements, accommodating changes and improvements throughout the development process.

*Carrot:*

Feature: User Profile Updates

Scenario: User Updates Personal Information

Given the user is on the profile page
When the user edits their personal information and saves the changes
Then the system should save the updated information

By understanding these benefits of Carrot and the challenges with traditional PRDs, product teams can embrace a more effective approach to writing product requirements. Carrot's structured syntax, collaboration opportunities, testability, and flexibility contribute to a streamlined product development process and improved outcomes.
