# Scenario Outlines: Using Scenario Outlines for Parameterization and Data-Driven Testing

Scenario Outlines in Carrot provide a powerful way to create parameterized scenarios and perform data-driven testing. They allow you to define a scenario template and provide different sets of input values through Examples tables. In this document, we will explore how to effectively use Scenario Outlines in Carrot using the Carrot syntax.

## 1. Understanding Scenario Outlines in Carrot

Scenario Outlines in Carrot are similar to regular scenarios but with the ability to parameterize the steps using placeholders. These placeholders are then replaced with actual values from the Examples tables during test execution. This allows you to run the same scenario with different input values, making your tests more versatile and reusable.

### 1.1 Creating a Scenario Outline

To create a Scenario Outline in Carrot, you need to follow a specific structure:

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: <Scenario Outline Title>
  Given <Precondition>
  When <Action>
  Then <Expected Result>

  Examples:
  | <Parameter 1> | <Parameter 2> | ... |
  | <Value 1>     | <Value 2>     | ... |
  | <Value 3>     | <Value 4>     | ... |
  ...
```

In the above structure, `<Scenario Outline Title>` represents the title of the Scenario Outline, `<Precondition>`, `<Action>`, and `<Expected Result>` represent the steps of the scenario, and `<Parameter>` and `<Value>` represent the placeholders and corresponding values in the Examples table.

### 1.2 Using Parameters in Steps

Parameters in Scenario Outlines are denoted by placeholders enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`). These placeholders act as variables that are replaced with actual values from the Examples table during test execution.

#### Example:

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Login with Different User Credentials
  Given I am on the login page
  When I enter "<Username>" in the username field
  And I enter "<Password>" in the password field
  And I click the login button
  Then I should see the "<ExpectedMessage>"

  Examples:
  | Username  | Password | ExpectedMessage             |
  | user1     | pass1    | Welcome, user1!             |
  | user2     | pass2    | Welcome, user2!             |
  | admin     | admin123 | Welcome, admin! You're in.  |
```

In the above example, the steps `When I enter "<Username>" in the username field` and `And I enter "<Password>" in the password field` contain placeholders for the username and password. These placeholders will be replaced with the corresponding values from the Examples table during test execution.

### 1.3 Generating Test Cases from Scenario Outlines

Scenario Outlines are not executed directly. Instead, they serve as templates to generate multiple test cases based on the values provided in the Examples table. Each row in the Examples table represents a separate test case with specific input values.

During test execution, Carrot will generate a separate test case for each row in the Examples table. This allows you to execute the same scenario with different input values and validate the expected results.

## 2. Data-Driven Testing with Scenario Outlines

One of the key benefits of Scenario Outlines is their ability to facilitate data-driven testing. By providing different sets of input values in the Examples table, you can verify the behavior of your system against various scenarios.

### 2.1 Testing Boundary Values

Boundary value testing is a technique that focuses on testing the edge cases of a system. Scenario Outlines can be used effectively to perform boundary value testing by providing values at or near the boundaries in the

 Examples table.

#### Example:

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Calculate Discount Based on Age
  Given a customer with age "<Age>"
  When the customer purchases an item worth "<Amount>"
  Then the discount should be "<ExpectedDiscount>"

  Examples:
  | Age | Amount | ExpectedDiscount |
  | 17  | 50     | No discount      |
  | 18  | 50     | 5%               |
  | 65  | 50     | 10%              |
  | 66  | 50     | 5%               |
  | 90  | 50     | No discount      |
```

In the above example, we are testing a discount calculation based on customer age. The Examples table includes values at the lower boundary (17 years), upper boundary (90 years), and the transition points (18 years and 65 years) to validate the discount calculation behavior.

### 2.2 Testing Combinations

Scenario Outlines are also useful for testing different combinations of input values. By providing various combinations in the Examples table, you can ensure that your system handles different scenarios correctly.

#### Example:

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Calculate Shipping Cost
  Given a customer with shipping location "<Location>"
  When the customer purchases "<Weight>" kg of items
  Then the shipping cost should be "<ExpectedCost>"

  Examples:
  | Location | Weight | ExpectedCost |
  | Local    | 1      | $5           |
  | Local    | 5      | $10          |
  | Local    | 10     | $15          |
  | International | 1 | $20          |
  | International | 5 | $30          |
  | International | 10| $40          |
```

In the above example, we are testing the calculation of shipping costs based on the customer's location and the weight of the items. The Examples table includes different combinations of location and weight to validate the shipping cost calculation for each scenario.

## Conclusion

Scenario Outlines in Carrot provide a powerful mechanism for parameterizing scenarios and performing data-driven testing. By utilizing the Carrot syntax for Scenario Outlines and Examples tables, you can create versatile and reusable scenarios that can be executed with different sets of input values. This allows you to test boundary values, validate combinations, and ensure the correctness of your system across various scenarios. Understanding how to effectively use Scenario Outlines will enhance the expressiveness and flexibility of your Carrot scenarios, making your tests more robust and efficient.
