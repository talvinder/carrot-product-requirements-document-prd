# Data Tables: Utilizing Data Tables in Carrot for Handling Structured Data

Data tables in Carrot provide a convenient way to work with structured data within scenarios. They allow you to represent tabular data and pass multiple values to steps in a structured format. In this document, we will explore how to effectively use data tables in Carrot using the Carrot syntax.

## 1. Using Data Tables in Carrot

Data tables in Carrot are typically used to represent tabular data with rows and columns. They are enclosed within vertical bars (`|`) and consist of multiple rows, each separated by a new line. The values within a row are separated by the pipe (`|`) symbol. Data tables can be passed as arguments to steps and accessed within step definitions.

### 1.1 Creating a Data Table

To create a data table in Carrot, you need to define the table structure by specifying the values in each row and column.

#### Example:
```gherkin
Scenario: Calculate Order Total
  Given the following products are added to the cart:
    | Product     | Quantity | Price |
    | iPhone 12   | 2        | $999  |
    | AirPods Pro | 1        | $249  |
  When I calculate the order total
  Then the total should be $2247
```

In the above example, we have created a data table representing the products added to the cart. Each row represents a product with its corresponding quantity and price.

### 1.2 Accessing Data Table Values in Step Definitions

To access the values of a data table within step definitions, you can use the `Table` type parameter in your step definition method. This parameter allows you to retrieve the values from the data table and process them as needed.

#### Example:
```javascript
Given('the following products are added to the cart:', function (dataTable) {
  const products = dataTable.hashes();
  // Access and process the data table values
});
```

In the above example, we are using the `Table` type parameter `dataTable` to retrieve the data table values. The `hashes()` method is then used to convert the data table into an array of objects, where each object represents a row from the data table.

### 1.3 Using Data Tables in Step Arguments

Data tables can be passed as arguments to steps to provide input or validate expected results. Steps can then access and manipulate the data table values as necessary.

#### Example:
```gherkin
When I calculate the order total for the following products:
  | Product     | Quantity | Price |
  | iPhone 12   | 2        | $999  |
  | AirPods Pro | 1        | $249  |
Then the total should be $2247
```

In the above example, we are passing the data table as an argument to the step `When I calculate the order total for the following products`. The step definition can then access the data table values to perform calculations and validate the expected result.

## 2. Working with Dynamic Data Tables

In some scenarios, you may need to work with dynamic data tables where the number of rows or columns is not known in advance. Carrot provides flexibility in handling such cases using step parameters and dynamic data table sizes.

### 2.1 Dynamic Data Tables with Variable Column Sizes

Carrot allows you to define data tables with variable column sizes by using step parameters in the step definition. This enables you to handle data tables with a dynamic number of columns.

#### Example:
```gherkin
When I calculate the total for the following products:
  | Product        | Price |
  | iPhone 12      | $999  |
  | AirPods Pro   

 | $249  |
  | Apple Watch SE | $299  |
Then the total should be $1547
```

In the above example, the step `When I calculate the total for the following products` expects a data table with two columns: `Product` and `Price`. The step definition can handle data tables with any number of columns as long as they match the defined parameters.

### 2.2 Dynamic Data Tables with Variable Row Sizes

Carrot also allows you to work with data tables that have a variable number of rows by using step parameters and iterating over the rows in the step definition.

#### Example:
```gherkin
When I calculate the total for each product:
  | Product     | Quantity | Price |
  | iPhone 12   | 2        | $999  |
  | AirPods Pro | 1        | $249  |
Then the total should be $2247
```

In the above example, the step `When I calculate the total for each product` expects a data table with three columns: `Product`, `Quantity`, and `Price`. The step definition can iterate over each row in the data table and perform calculations based on the values.

## Conclusion

Data tables in Carrot provide a powerful mechanism for working with structured data within scenarios. By utilizing the Carrot syntax for data tables, you can easily represent tabular data, pass multiple values to steps, and handle dynamic data tables with variable column or row sizes. Understanding how to effectively use data tables will enhance the expressiveness and flexibility of your Carrot scenarios, enabling you to handle complex test scenarios with ease.
