# Tags and Annotations: How to Use Tags and Annotations to Organize and Manage Carrot Scripts

Tags and annotations in Carrot provide a powerful way to organize, categorize, and manage scenarios and features. They allow you to group related scenarios, apply filters during test execution, and add additional metadata to your Carrot scripts. In this document, we will explore how to effectively use tags and annotations in Carrot, using the Carrot syntax.

## 1. Using Tags in Carrot

Tags in Carrot are used to categorize and organize scenarios and features. They are prefixed with the `@` symbol and can be placed before the `Feature` or `Scenario` sections. Tags can be used to filter scenarios during test execution, making it easy to run specific subsets of scenarios based on their tags.

### 1.1 Applying Tags to Features and Scenarios

To apply a tag to a feature or scenario, simply prefix the tag name with `@` and place it before the feature or scenario declaration.

#### Example:
```gherkin
@smoke-test
Feature: Login
  As a user
  I want to login to the system
  So that I can access my account

  Scenario: Successful Login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid credentials
    Then I should be logged in

@regression-test
Scenario: Password Reset
  Given I am on the password reset page
  When I enter my email
  Then I should receive a password reset email
```

In the above example, we have applied the `@smoke-test` tag to the `Login` feature and the `@regression-test` tag to the `Password Reset` scenario.

### 1.2 Filtering Scenarios Based on Tags

During test execution, you can use tags to filter and run specific subsets of scenarios. This is particularly useful when you want to focus on a specific set of tests, such as smoke tests or regression tests.

To run scenarios with specific tags, you can use the `--tags` flag when executing the Carrot tests.

#### Example:
```shell
carrot run --tags @smoke-test
```

The above command will execute only the scenarios that are tagged with `@smoke-test`.

## 2. Using Annotations in Carrot

Annotations in Carrot provide a way to add additional metadata or information to scenarios and steps. Annotations start with the `@` symbol and can be placed before any step or scenario outline example row. They can be used to provide additional context, mark important scenarios, or provide instructions for test automation frameworks.

### 2.1 Adding Annotations to Scenarios and Steps

To add an annotation to a scenario or step, simply prefix it with `@` and place it before the scenario or step declaration.

#### Example:
```gherkin
Scenario: Checkout
  Given I have added items to the cart
  When I proceed to checkout
  Then I should see the payment options
  @important @automated
  And I select "Credit Card" as the payment method
```

In the above example, we have added two annotations, `@important` and `@automated`, to the last step of the scenario.

### 2.2 Using Annotations for Automation Frameworks

Annotations can be used to provide instructions or metadata for test automation frameworks. For example, you can use annotations to mark scenarios that require special handling or to define custom behavior for test runners.

#### Example:
```gherkin
@retries(3) @timeout(10s)
Scenario: Login with Invalid Credentials
  Given I am on the login page
  When I enter invalid credentials
  Then I should see an error message
``

`

In the above example, we have used annotations `@retries(3)` and `@timeout(10s)` to instruct the automation framework to retry the scenario three times and set a timeout of 10 seconds.

## Conclusion

Tags and annotations in Carrot provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and manage your Carrot scripts. By applying tags to features and scenarios, you can easily categorize and filter scenarios based on their tags during test execution. Annotations, on the other hand, allow you to add additional metadata and instructions to scenarios and steps, providing context and customization for your test automation frameworks. Proper usage of tags and annotations can greatly enhance the readability, maintainability, and efficiency of your Carrot scripts.
