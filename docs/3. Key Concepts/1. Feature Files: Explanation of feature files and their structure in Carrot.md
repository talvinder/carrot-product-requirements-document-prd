# Feature Files: Explanation of Feature Files and their Structure in Carrot

Feature files play a crucial role in defining the behavior and functionality of a software system using the Carrot syntax. In this document, we will explore the structure and components of feature files in Carrot, along with examples that demonstrate the usage of Carrot-specific keywords.

## 1. What are Feature Files?

Feature files are plain text files written in the Carrot syntax that capture the desired behavior of a software system from a user's perspective. They provide a high-level overview of the features and scenarios to be implemented. Feature files serve as living documentation and can be used for collaboration between stakeholders, developers, and testers.

## 2. Structure of Feature Files

A feature file in Carrot follows a specific structure and consists of the following components:

### 2.1 Feature Section

The feature section provides a high-level description of the feature and its purpose. It includes the feature keyword followed by a unique title. Additionally, it can contain a user story, objectives, or any other relevant information.

Example:
```gherkin
Feature: Shopping cart
  As a visitor
  I want to add products to the cart
  So that I can buy the products together
```

### 2.2 Background Section (Optional)

The background section is used to define common preconditions that apply to all scenarios within the feature file. It consists of one or more Given or And steps. These steps set up the initial state or context for the scenarios.

Example:
```gherkin
Background:
  Given User is on the search result page
```

### 2.3 Scenario Section

The scenario section represents a specific behavior or functionality of the system. It consists of a one-line title that describes the scenario and multiple Given, When, and Then steps. Each step represents a specific action or assertion.

Example:
```gherkin
Scenario: Adding a product to the cart
  Given the user is on the product page
  When the user clicks on the "Add to Cart" button
  Then the product should be added to the cart
  And the cart total should be updated
```

### 2.4 Scenario Outline Section (Optional)

The scenario outline section is used when you have multiple similar scenarios with different sets of data. It is templated and uses placeholder values enclosed in `<` and `>` symbols. The actual values are provided in the Examples section.

Example:
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Searching for a product
  Given the user is on the home page
  When the user enters "<searchTerm>" in the search bar
  Then the search results should display relevant products

  Examples:
    | searchTerm |
    | "carrot"   |
    | "apple"    |
```

### 2.5 Examples Section (Optional)

The examples section is used to provide multiple sets of data for a scenario outline. Each row in the table represents a combination of values that will be used to replace the placeholders in the scenario outline.

Example:
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Searching for a product
  Given the user is on the home page
  When the user enters "<searchTerm>" in the search bar
  Then the search results should display relevant products

  Examples:
    | searchTerm |
    | "carrot"   |
    | "apple"    |
```

### 2.6 Carrot-specific Keywords

Carrot introduces additional keywords that can be used in feature files to provide more context, design information, success criteria, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

Example:
```gherkin
Scenario: Adding a product to the cart
  Given the user is on the product page
  When the user clicks

 on the "Add to Cart" button
  Then the product should be added to the cart

  Design: [Figma Link](https://figma.com/design123)
  Success: Improved add to cart experience
  KPI: Add to cart clicked / Add to cart successful
  Impact: Improved cart additions and reduced bounce off
```

## Conclusion

Feature files in Carrot provide a structured and readable format to define the behavior of a software system. By following the guidelines and utilizing the Carrot-specific keywords, you can effectively capture the desired functionality and collaborate with stakeholders, developers, and testers.
