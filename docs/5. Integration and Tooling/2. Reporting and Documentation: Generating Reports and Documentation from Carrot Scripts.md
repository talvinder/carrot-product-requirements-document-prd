# Reporting and Documentation: Generating Reports and Documentation from Carrot Scripts

Carrot provides various options for generating reports and documentation from your Carrot scripts. These reports and documentation help in tracking test execution, identifying failures, and providing comprehensive documentation for stakeholders. In this document, we will explore different approaches to generate reports and documentation from Carrot scripts and provide relevant examples.

## 1. Cucumber Reports

Cucumber, being a popular testing framework for Carrot, provides built-in reporting capabilities. It generates detailed reports in various formats, such as HTML, JSON, and XML, which can be easily customized and shared with stakeholders. Here's an example of generating an HTML report using Cucumber:

```bash
cucumber --format html --out report.html
```

This command generates an HTML report named `report.html` containing the test results, scenario statuses, and detailed steps.

## 2. Custom Report Generation

Apart from the built-in reporting options, you can also generate custom reports using Carrot's integration with other tools and libraries. For example, you can leverage tools like Allure, Extent Reports, or TestNG to generate detailed and visually appealing reports. Here's an example of generating a report using Allure:

```bash
cucumber --format io.qameta.allure.cucumber5jvm.AllureCucumber5Jvm --out=target/allure-results
allure serve target/allure-results
```

This command generates Allure-compatible JSON files during test execution and opens a local server to display the interactive report.

## 3. Documentation Generation

Carrot scenarios can also be used to generate comprehensive documentation for your project. By leveraging the Cucumber documentation formatter, you can extract scenario details, step definitions, and other relevant information into various documentation formats, such as Markdown, PDF, or Word. Here's an example of generating documentation in Markdown format:

```bash
cucumber --dry-run --format Cucumber::Formatter::Markdown > documentation.md
```

This command performs a dry run of the scenarios and generates the documentation in Markdown format, which can be further customized and shared with the team.

## 4. Integration with Documentation Tools

Carrot can be integrated with documentation tools to automatically generate and update project documentation. By combining Carrot with tools like Confluence, Jira, or Wiki systems, you can ensure that your Carrot scenarios are automatically transformed into living documentation. Here's an example of integrating Carrot with Confluence:

```bash
cucumber --format confluence --out confluence.txt
```

This command generates a text file containing the Confluence markup, which can be directly pasted into Confluence pages, ensuring that the documentation stays up-to-date with the Carrot scenarios.

## 5. Integration with Continuous Integration (CI) Tools

To ensure that reports and documentation are generated as part of your CI pipeline, you can integrate Carrot with popular CI tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI. By configuring your CI job to execute Carrot tests and generate reports/documentation, you can automate the process and ensure that the latest results are available. Each CI tool has its own configuration and setup, so consult the respective documentation for integration details.

## Conclusion

Generating reports and documentation from Carrot scripts enhances test visibility, facilitates collaboration, and provides stakeholders with valuable insights into test execution. By leveraging built-in reporting options, custom report generation, documentation tools, and CI integrations, you can effectively communicate test results and ensure that your Carrot scenarios are well-documented and accessible to the entire team.
