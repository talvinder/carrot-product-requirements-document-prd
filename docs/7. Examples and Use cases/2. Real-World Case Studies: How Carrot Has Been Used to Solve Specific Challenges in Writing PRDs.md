# Real-World Case Studies: How Carrot Has Been Used to Solve Specific Challenges in Writing PRDs

In this document, we will explore real-world case studies that highlight how Carrot, an extension of Gherkin, has been used in actual projects to overcome specific challenges in writing Product Requirement Documents (PRDs). Carrot's enhanced syntax and extensive keyword set provide teams with powerful tools to express their requirements in a structured and readable manner. The following examples demonstrate the effectiveness of Carrot in real-world PRD writing scenarios.

## 1. Case Study: Mobile Application Development

### Challenge:
A mobile app development company faced challenges in expressing and documenting the functional requirements for their mobile application. They needed a standardized format that would capture all the necessary details while remaining easily understandable for stakeholders.

### Solution:
The team adopted Carrot syntax to write their PRDs, leveraging its extended keywords to structure and organize the requirements effectively. They used keywords such as `Feature`, `Background`, `Scenario`, and `Given/When/Then` steps to express different aspects of the application's functionality. They also utilized Carrot's `Tags` feature to categorize requirements based on different modules or user roles.

Example:
```gherkin
Feature: User Registration

  Background:
    Given the user is on the registration screen

  Scenario: Successful Registration
    When the user enters their name, email, and password
    And clicks on the "Register" button
    Then the user should be successfully registered

  Scenario: Registration with Existing Email
    When the user enters an email that already exists in the system
    And clicks on the "Register" button
    Then an error message should be displayed
    And the user should not be registered
```

### Result:
By using Carrot to write their PRDs, the team improved the clarity and structure of their requirements documentation. Stakeholders could easily understand the expected behavior of the mobile application, leading to better alignment between the development team and stakeholders. The standardized format of Carrot syntax ensured that all necessary details were captured in a consistent manner.

## 2. Case Study: Web Application Enhancement

### Challenge:
A web development team needed to enhance an existing web application and communicate the desired changes effectively to the development team. They faced challenges in providing detailed and specific requirements that covered both functional and non-functional aspects.

### Solution:
The team embraced Carrot syntax to write their PRDs, leveraging its extended keywords to express a wide range of requirements. They used keywords such as `Feature`, `Scenario`, `Given/When/Then` steps, and `Tags` to cover various aspects of the web application. They also utilized Carrot's `Data Tables` to provide structured input and output examples for complex features.

Example:
```gherkin
Feature: User Management

  Scenario: Create User
    Given the user is logged in as an admin
    When the admin creates a new user with the following details:
      | Name    | Email              | Role      |
      | John    | john@example.com   | Admin     |
    Then the user should be created successfully

  Scenario: Update User Role
    Given the user is logged in as an admin
    When the admin updates the role of the user with email "john@example.com" to "Moderator"
    Then the user's role should be updated successfully
```

### Result:
By utilizing Carrot syntax for their PRDs, the web development team effectively communicated their requirements to the development team. The use of descriptive scenarios and steps ensured that both functional and non-functional aspects were captured. The structured input examples provided in data tables allowed for clear expectations and reduced ambiguity.

## Conclusion

The real-world case studies presented above demonstrate how Carrot's extended syntax and keywords have

 been successfully utilized to address specific challenges in writing PRDs. By leveraging Carrot's features, teams can express their requirements in a structured and readable manner, leading to improved communication, enhanced documentation, and ultimately, better software development outcomes.

Consider these examples as inspiration for adopting Carrot in your own PRD writing processes. Experiment with different keywords and features to tailor Carrot to your specific project requirements. With Carrot, you can create clear, concise, and maintainable PRDs that effectively capture the essence of your product vision.
