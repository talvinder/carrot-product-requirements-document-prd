# Example Scenarios: A Collection of Example Carrot Scenarios

In this document, we will explore a collection of example Carrot scenarios that demonstrate various features and use cases of Carrot syntax. Carrot, being an extension of Gherkin, provides an extensive set of keywords to express scenarios in a clear and concise manner. The following examples showcase the versatility and power of Carrot syntax.

## 1. Scenario: User Registration
```gherkin
Scenario: User Registration
  Given a user is on the registration page
  When the user fills in the registration form with the following data:
    | Field         | Value           |
    | Username      | john_doe        |
    | Email         | john@example.com|
    | Password      | Pa55w0rd!       |
  And the user clicks the submit button
  Then the user should be registered successfully
```
This scenario demonstrates the registration process where a user fills in the registration form with specific data and expects successful registration.

## 2. Scenario: Login with Valid Credentials
```gherkin
Scenario: Login with Valid Credentials
  Given a user is on the login page
  When the user enters the following credentials:
    | Username      | john_doe        |
    | Password      | Pa55w0rd!       |
  And the user clicks the login button
  Then the user should be logged in successfully
```
This scenario verifies that a user can successfully log in with valid credentials.

## 3. Scenario: Login with Invalid Credentials
```gherkin
Scenario: Login with Invalid Credentials
  Given a user is on the login page
  When the user enters the following credentials:
    | Username      | john_doe        |
    | Password      | wrong_password  |
  And the user clicks the login button
  Then the user should see an error message "Invalid credentials"
```
This scenario tests the behavior of the login page when the user enters invalid credentials.

## 4. Scenario: Add Product to Cart
```gherkin
Scenario: Add Product to Cart
  Given a user is on the homepage
  When the user searches for the product "iPhone 12"
  And the user adds the product to the cart
  Then the cart should contain the product "iPhone 12"
```
This scenario validates that a user can add a specific product to the cart and verifies the presence of the product in the cart.

## 5. Scenario: Checkout Process
```gherkin
Scenario: Checkout Process
  Given a user has added the following products to the cart:
    | Product       | Quantity |
    | iPhone 12     | 1        |
    | MacBook Pro   | 2        |
  When the user proceeds to checkout
  And the user fills in the shipping information
  And the user selects the payment method "Credit Card"
  And the user completes the checkout process
  Then the user should receive an order confirmation
```
This scenario simulates the end-to-end checkout process, including adding products to the cart, providing shipping information, selecting a payment method, and completing the checkout. It also verifies the successful order confirmation.

## 6. Scenario: Search and Filter Products
```gherkin
Scenario: Search and Filter Products
  Given a user is on the homepage
  When the user searches for the keyword "laptop"
  And the user applies the following filters:
    | Category    | Electronics |
    | Brand       | Apple       |
    | Price Range | $1000-$2000 |
  Then the user should see a list of laptops matching the filters
```
This scenario demonstrates the search and filter functionality, where a user searches for a keyword, applies

 various filters, and expects to see a list of products that match the applied filters.

## Conclusion

The examples provided above showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of Carrot syntax. With its rich set of keywords and extensions, Carrot allows you to write clear, concise, and maintainable scenarios for various testing scenarios. Feel free to leverage these examples as a reference for writing your own Carrot scenarios and explore the full potential of Carrot syntax in your testing efforts.
