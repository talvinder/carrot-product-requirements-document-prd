# Writing Scenarios: Examples and Guidelines for Writing Expressive Scenarios using Carrot

Scenarios play a crucial role in defining the behavior and expected outcomes of a software system. Well-written scenarios help in better understanding, collaboration, and testing of the system. In this document, we will explore examples and guidelines for writing expressive scenarios using the Carrot syntax. These examples and guidelines will help you create scenarios that are clear, concise, and effective in capturing the desired behavior of your software.

## 1. Keep Scenarios Focused and Atomic

Each scenario should focus on a single behavior or functionality to ensure clarity and maintainability. It is recommended to keep scenarios atomic, meaning they should cover a specific aspect of the system's behavior.

### Example:

```gherkin
Scenario: Adding a product to the cart
  Given the user is on the product page
  When the user clicks on the "Add to Cart" button
  Then the product should be added to the cart
  And the cart total should be updated
```

## 2. Use Given-When-Then Structure

Following the Given-When-Then structure helps in organizing scenarios and making them more understandable. The Given step sets up the initial state or context, the When step represents the action being performed, and the Then step defines the expected outcome.

### Example:

```gherkin
Scenario: Logging in with valid credentials
  Given the user is on the login page
  When the user enters valid credentials and clicks the "Login" button
  Then the user should be logged in successfully
```

## 3. Make Scenarios Readable and Understandable

Scenarios should be written in a way that is easily readable and understandable by all stakeholders, including developers, testers, and business users. Use clear and concise language, avoid technical jargon, and focus on the desired behavior.

### Example:

```gherkin
Scenario: Searching for a product
  Given the user is on the home page
  When the user enters "carrot" in the search bar and clicks the "Search" button
  Then the search results should display relevant products
```

## 4. Leverage Background Section for Common Preconditions

If multiple scenarios share common preconditions, use the Background section to define them. This reduces duplication and keeps the scenarios focused on their specific behavior.

### Example:

```gherkin
Background:
  Given the user is logged in
  And the user has products in the cart

Scenario: Adding a product to the cart
  When the user clicks on the "Add to Cart" button
  Then the product should be added to the cart
  And the cart total should be updated

Scenario: Removing a product from the cart
  When the user clicks on the "Remove" button for a product
  Then the product should be removed from the cart
  And the cart total should be updated
```

## 5. Use Descriptive Step Definitions

Each step in a scenario should be descriptive and specific to the action being performed. Avoid vague or generic step definitions to maintain clarity and readability.

### Example:

```gherkin
Scenario: Updating user profile
  Given the user is on their profile page
  When the user clicks on the "Edit" button
  And the user updates their email address
  And the user saves the changes
  Then the user's profile should be updated with the new email address
```

## 6. Provide Context with Background Information

In complex scenarios, provide additional context by including background information or relevant details. This helps in better understanding the scenario and its purpose.

### Example:

```gherkin
Scenario: Placing an order with multiple products
  Given the user is logged in


  And the user has selected multiple products
  And the user is on the checkout page
  When the user enters shipping and payment details
  Then the order should be placed successfully
  And the user should receive an order confirmation email
```

## 7. Use Tags for Organization and Filtering

Tags can be used to organize scenarios into categories or to filter specific scenarios during test execution. Tags are prefixed with the "@" symbol and can be added before the Feature or Scenario sections.

### Example:

```gherkin
@SmokeTest
Scenario: Homepage displays featured products
  Given the user is on the home page
  Then the featured products section should be visible
```

## 8. Document Design and Success Criteria

Carrot allows you to document additional information related to design and success criteria within each scenario. Use these sections to provide relevant links, KPIs, and expected impacts.

### Example:

```gherkin
Scenario: Adding a product to the cart
  Given the user is on the product page
  When the user clicks on the "Add to Cart" button
  Then the product should be added to the cart
  And the cart total should be updated

  Design: [Figma Link](https://figma.com/design123)
  Success: Improved add to cart experience
  KPI: Add to cart clicked / Add to cart successful
  Impact: Improved cart additions and reduced bounce off
```

By following these guidelines and examples, you can write expressive scenarios using the Carrot syntax. Remember to keep your scenarios focused, readable, and organized to effectively capture the behavior of your software.
