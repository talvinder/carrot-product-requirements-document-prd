## Examples

### Feature and User Story

FEATURE Shopping cart

As a visitor

I will like to add products to the cart

so that I can buy the products together



### Problem Statement

PROBLEM Too many steps across products

Buying our products requires a lot of steps. The visitor browses the website to find one or more products. Then they click on the Whatsapp icon on-site to launch a chat with us on Whatsapp. Then they paste the link of the products they liked, we confirm if the products are available and how soon will they be delivered. Then we share a QR code on Whatsapp for them to make the payment. Post this, we update our backend inventory and create a shipping request to service the order. These are a lot of steps for simple ordering and hence causing operational issues and customer dissatisfaction.


### Scenario with Steps

Scenario: Logged in User

Given: User is logged in

And: User has products in the cart

When: User clicks on Add to Cart button

Then: New product is added to items in cart

And: Successful message is displayed to user “<Product> added to cart”

And: Count of items in the cart increases in realtime without page refresh


### Design and Success Criteria

Design: https://figma.com/random-something

Success: Improved add to cart experience

Kpi: add to cart clicked/add to cart successful

Benchmark: 99.9999% success rate on add to cart addition

Impact: Improved cart additions and reduced bounce off
